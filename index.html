                <h4>Unreal Engine</h4>
                <p>
                  I have developed a variety of characters, pawns, and actors in Unreal Engine, ensuring they are fully functional and integrated into the game environment. My work with the Gameplay Ability System includes designing and implementing complex abilities, effects, and events. I've created animation blendspaces, state machines, and animation triggers to bring game assets to life. Additionally, I have experience creating behavior trees and custom nodes using C++ to implement advanced AI behaviors. I have also designed and implemented UI widgets to create intuitive and interactive user interfaces. Proficient in both Blueprints and C++, I create flexible and efficient game logic, using Blueprints for rapid prototyping and C++ for performance-critical functionalities.

                <h4>Unity</h4>
                <p>experience
                  I have extensive experience working with Unity, where I have developed a first-person shooter (FPS) game. My work includes creating complex boss characters with multiple mechanics, utilizing NavMesh for advanced pathfinding and AI navigation. I have implemented detailed animations and behavior trees to bring characters to life, along with animation triggers to ensure smooth transitions. Additionally, I have designed immersive environments and developed intuitive UI interfaces to enhance the player . My skills in Unity encompass a wide range of game development aspects, from AI behavior and animation to environment design and user interface creation, ensuring a comprehensive and engaging gameplay experience.

                <p>
                  OpenGL is the primary Graphical API I currently have expierience in, i've developed a full graphical engine with gameplay using this API. This engine features advanced rendering techniques such as lambertian shading and specular reflections, along with post-processing effects implemented in the shader. I also created a robust UI rendering system to enhance user interaction. Using Blender, I exported all assets with precise locations into my graphics engine, ensuring seamless integration and quality visuals. Additionally, I collaborated with a team to develop an Venture game clone, where players collect treasure and avoid enemy attacks, showcasing my ability to work effectively in a team environment and deliver engaging gameplay experiences.

              <p>
                SpellStorm is an exciting 3rd Person Action Platformer currently in development using Unreal Engine 5. As my capstone project, I am proud to serve as both the Gameplay Programmer and Team Lead. Our vision for this game is to create a dynamic, action-packed platformer where players wield a diverse arsenal of spells.
                We’ve implemented a unique spell queue system, allowing players to combine four base elements to cast a variety of powerful spells. We’re aiming to have a prototype ready in the coming months, but you can already download our current build on Itch!

              <p>
                Invasion is a first-person shooter developed in Unity, where players find themselves waking up after a crash landing on Mars. Drawing inspiration from iconic titles like Doom and Halo from the Xbox 360 era, the game blends classic FPS elements with modern design.
                Created as a midterm project at Full Sail University, Invasion was a collaborative effort where I played a crucial role in nearly every facet of development, including user interface design, artificial intelligence, combat mechanics, and level creation.

                Dungeon Divers is a modern homage to the classic arcade game, Venture. Players control a character navigating through a maze teeming with monsters. The objective is to collect all the treasure and successfully traverse each level to escape.

                In this project, I served as the graphics programmer. My contributions included implementing post-processing effects, Lambertian shading, specular reflection, and ambient lighting. Additionally, I designed the entire UI framework using Blender and custom C++ UI classes.

              <h4>Rotating Cube</h4>
              <p>
                The rotating cube project was a foundational exercise in graphics programming that introduced me to the essentials of computer graphics and rendering. In this project, I created a cube and a grid using vertices, drew lines between these vertices, and set up a camera to change the viewpoint of the cube as it spins.

                To draw the lines, I implemented a line-drawing algorithm that connects the vertices of the cube and the grid. This involved calculating the positions of the vertices in 3D space and projecting them onto the 2D raster window. I then used these projected coordinates to draw lines between the vertices, creating the edges of the cube and the grid.

                Additionally, I wrote the rendered output to the raster window, ensuring that the lines and shapes were correctly displayed. This required managing the raster buffer and updating it with the new frame data for each rotation of the cube.
                <br>
                <br>
                The project features three modes:
                <br>
                <br>
                Default Mode: A spinning green outline of the cube. <br>
                Depth Mode: A colored depth representation of the cube. <br>
                Texturing Mode: Utilizes UV mapping and barycentric coordinates to apply textures to the cube’s surfaces. <br>

                ChatServer is an application that was designed to test my skills in Network Programming. It functions as a server compatible with the Spaghetti Relay client application.
                <br><br>Key features of the Chat Server include:
                <br> <br>
                Server Logging <br>
                User registration and login <br>
                Sending Chat messages over UDP broadcast <br>
                Sending chat messages over TCP <br>
                Error checking with feedback <br><br>
                The Spaghetti Relay allows multiple instances to connect to the server, enabling message exchanges between different clients or broadcasting messages to all connected clients.

              <h4>Game of Life</h4>
              <p>
                This application is based on Conway's Game Of Life, and served as a programming excerise. This application has many options such as being able to change the color of several elements, toggling the neighbor count and the HUD. Additionally, you can update the size of grid to see more of complex patterns, and you can randomize the seed for a randomized start point.
                I coded the majority of this application, using a Windows Form Framework, as part of one of my classes at Full Sail University.
